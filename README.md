HTML5 Playground is an small website to show some of the new APIS of the HTML standard. Currently only 4 functionalities are supported:
- **Local storage:** Stores input value every time this change and reload it on each new session.
- **Session storage:** Similar to the previous one but in this ocasion the value is only available for the current session.
- **Geolocation:** Gets the user geolocation.
- **Page visibility:** Detects whenever the page lost the focus (ie. new tab).
